| [01](./day01/) | SQL                    | Yesterday           | Decided to solve day 1 in SQL and it ended up being very straightforward and I think quite elegant single queries                                                                                                                                         |
| [02](./day02/) | JAVA                   | Not long ago enough | Slight tongue-in-cheek nod to the theme of slightly antiquated languages, I solved this one in JAVA ... so much code ...                                                                                                                                  |
| [03](./day03/) | PHP                    | Circa 2005          | I thought I may as well continue the theme and picked PHP. That was annoying and I lost so much time to a silly dynamic type issue                                                                                                                        |
| [04](./day04/) | Coldfusion             | Circa 1999          | On request, and for the first time in over 20 years, I did something Coldfusion. I fairly quickly realised that off-by-one errors were going to be likely and kept things simple. Coldfusion is sooo slow                                                 |
| [05](./day05/) | Perl                   | Circa 2001          | Using Perl for day 5 wasn't a bad option apart from also not having used it for 20 or so years and forgetting  how awkward it is.                                                                                                                         |
| [06](./day06/) | JavaScript (pre ES5)   | Circa 2012          | Along with SQL on the first day, I enjoyed this one a lot more than the other languages so far. Considering how long ago it was since I used JavaScript, I consider it "old school", so pre-ES5 style JavaScript (except the deep-clone cheat for part 2. |
| [07](./day07/) | JavaScript (post ES25) | Never               | As I quite enjoyed the JS solution yesterday, I decided to pick JS again, but try to write ES6 idiomatic code. This was quite nice actually. I didn't figure out a way to optimise the code, but the code itself should be easy to read and understand.   |
| [08](./day08/) | TypeScript             | Never               | Continuing the JavaScript theme, I thought I'd try TypeScript. It was ok, but struggled with a bug. I think I'll come back to this language.                                                                                                              |
