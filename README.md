| [01](./day01/) | SQL        | Decided to solve day 1 in SQL and it ended up being very straightforward and I think quite elegant single queries                                                                                         |
| [02](./day02/) | JAVA       | Slight tongue-in-cheek nod to the theme of slightly antiquated languages, I solved this one in JAVA ... so much code ...                                                                                  |
| [03](./day03/) | PHP        | I thought I may as well continue the theme and picked PHP. That was annoying and I lost so much time to a silly dynamic type issue                                                                        |
| [04](./day04/) | Coldfusion | On request, and for the first time in over 20 years, I did something Coldfusion. I fairly quickly realised that off-by-one errors were going to be likely and kept things simple. Coldfusion is sooo slow |
| [05](./day05/) | Perl       | Using Perl for day 5 wasn't a bad option apart from also not having used it for 20 or so years and forgetting  how awkard it is.                                                                          |
