| [01](./day01/) | SQL                   | Yesterday           | Decided to solve day 1 in SQL and it ended up being very straightforward and I think quite elegant single queries                                                                                                                                         |
| [02](./day02/) | JAVA                  | Not long ago enough | Slight tongue-in-cheek nod to the theme of slightly antiquated languages, I solved this one in JAVA ... so much code ...                                                                                                                                  |
| [03](./day03/) | PHP                   | Circa 2005          | I thought I may as well continue the theme and picked PHP. That was annoying and I lost so much time to a silly dynamic type issue                                                                                                                        |
| [04](./day04/) | Coldfusion            | Circa 1999          | On request, and for the first time in over 20 years, I did something Coldfusion. I fairly quickly realised that off-by-one errors were going to be likely and kept things simple. Coldfusion is sooo slow                                                 |
| [05](./day05/) | Perl                  | Circa 2001          | Using Perl for day 5 wasn't a bad option apart from also not having used it for 20 or so years and forgetting  how awkward it is.                                                                                                                         |
| [06](./day06/) | JavaScript (pre ES5)  | Circa 2012          | Along with SQL on the first day, I enjoyed this one a lot more than the other languages so far. Considering how long ago it was since I used JavaScript, I consider it "old school", so pre-ES5 style JavaScript (except the deep-clone cheat for part 2. |
| [07](./day07/) | JavaScript (post ES5) | Never               | As I quite enjoyed the JS solution yesterday, I decided to pick JS again, but try to write ES6 idiomatic code. This was quite nice actually. I didn't figure out a way to optimise the code, but the code itself should be easy to read and understand.   |
| [08](./day08/) | TypeScript            | Never               | Continuing the JavaScript theme, I thought I'd try TypeScript. It was ok, but struggled with a bug. I think I'll come back to this language.                                                                                                              |
| [09](./day09/) | Kotlin                | This morning        | Taking a break from funny languages and completed this one in Kotlin. Part1 very easy, part 2 became a bit messier and I should clean up the code really.                                                                                                 |
| [10](./day10/) | Python                | Not long ago        | Still taking a break from silly languages and may do for a bit longer as I'm time poor. Python was good for this problem, but I wasted too much time by not reading the question correctly and solving what turned out to be part 2 :(                    |
| [11](./day11/) | Mojo                  | Never               | I thought Mojo was going to be a bit of a cheat as it's supposed to be like Python, but it turns out I should have RTFM. Luckily I got some help from claude.ai, but it was still a struggle to get the syntax right.                                     |
| [12](./day12/) | Groovy (sort of)       | Never properly            | I started of trying to solve this one in groovy, but quickly started struggling, so I reverted to Python, then decided to give [cursor](https://www.cursor.com/) a go and teach me how to use Groovy properly, which was actually pretty good. It was sort of fun, but may give up trying to solve these with unfamiliar languages from now on ;)                                     |
